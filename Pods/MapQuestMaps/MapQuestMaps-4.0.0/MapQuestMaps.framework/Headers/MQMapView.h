 The `MQMapViewTrafficDelegate` protocol defines a set of optional methods that you

 require the `MQMapView` class to load data asynchronously, the map view calls
 these methods to notify your application when specific operations complete. The

 displayed on the map, such as the styles and interaction modes to apply to
 individual annotations.
